# Themes and Templates

Webiny is a [headless Content Management System](./about.md), meaning it doesn't have a presentation layer. Themes in Webiny are simple definitions of the presentation layer structure. The presentation layer itself is de-attached from the system and is control by the developer.

This approach gives you the ability to display the same content on many devices and screen sizes. For example you can display the content on a NodeJS powered website, smart watch or a SmartTV. The options are endless as the date returned from the CMS is a simple JSON object.
